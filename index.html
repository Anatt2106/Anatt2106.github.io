  <p style="color: black;">Once upon a time, three friends were travelling. They were very rich. They carried gold coins and jewels with them. They had their army to serve them. While they were going to their destination, they passed through a village. The people looked very poor. They had not enough clothes to wear; they wore torn clothes. Also, the children and older people appeared very skinny and severely malnourished.

    All three rich people felt sad seeing their condition. One of them could not stop himself from helping them. He abruptly came out of his car. Then, he shared all the gold coins and jewels he had with the villagers. He then prayed for their good fortune and left. 
    
    The second person also went there. He had tears seeing their pathetic condition. He thought that the gold and jewels did not have any use for the villagers. So he shared all his food and beverages equally with the villagers. He felt very proud as he thought that he gave the villagers some food that would last for at least a couple of days.
    
    Then he returned to his friends. Two of them waited for the third to go, and help the needy. But, he did not take a step and asked them to sit back. It surprised them. Both of them thought how cruel he is! They sat back in the car and continued their journey.
    
    On the way, the rich man thought about how he could help those poor villagers. He tried to find a way so that they can get rid of poverty. He had an idea! When they reached the destination, he did not take any rest. He went out and bought farming equipment, sacks of seeds and grain with all his gold and jewels.
    
    After a few days, they were returning to their home. On the way, when they again crossed by that village, the third rich man stopped the car. This time, he got out of his car. He took out all the equipment and seeds from his car. Both of the friends were surprised and felt sorry. All three friends came together and distributed all items equally. They also shared the best practices to obtain high-quality crops.
    
    Then, they all came to their home happily.</p>
